REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by this application template that your Web server supports PHP 5.4.0.


INSTALLATION
------------

### Install from an Archive File

Extract the archive file downloaded from [yiiframework.com](http://www.yiiframework.com/download/) to
a directory named `advanced` that is directly under the Web root.

Then follow the instructions given in "GETTING STARTED".


### Install via Composer

If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

for example:

~~~
php -r "readfile('https://getcomposer.org/installer');" | php
~~~

You can then load framework/extension using the following command:

~~~
php -f composer.phar update
~~~


GETTING STARTED
---------------

After you install the application, you have to conduct the following steps to initialize
the installed application. You only need to do these once for all.

1. Run command `init` to initialize the application with a specific environment.
2. Create a new database and adjust the `components['db']` configuration in `common/config/main-local.php` accordingly.
3. Apply migrations with console command `yii migrate`. This will create tables needed for the application to work.
4. Create domain my-yii2-app.dev and forward to root folder yii2_start_app_template

- alias to frontend `http://my-yii2-app.dev/`
- alias to backend `http://my-yii2-app.dev/admin`
